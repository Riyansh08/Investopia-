This repository contains the Investopia Project, which includes three main parts:

1. **Frontend**: The user-facing part of the application built with modern web technologies.
2. **Backend**: The server-side logic and API services to power the frontend and dashboard.
3. **Dashboard**: A data visualization and management panel to monitor and control various aspects of the application.

Deployment

To deploy the project, follow these steps:

Step 1: Setup GitHub Repository
Push the project to your GitHub repository if it's not already done:


git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for Investopia project"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/investopia-project.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Step 2: Frontend Deployment
You can deploy the frontend on Vercel or Netlify.

Build the frontend for production:

npm run build
Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel or Netlify and deploy the frontend folder.
Step 3: Backend Deployment
Deploy the backend to Heroku, Render, or DigitalOcean. Ensure you configure the environment variables on the hosting platform.

Step 4: Dashboard Deployment
The dashboard can be deployed similarly to the frontend. Use Vercel or Netlify, and deploy the dashboard folder.

Usage

Frontend: The frontend is the user interface of the application, where users interact with Investopia.
